> **Disclaimer:** Do not forget this project is first and foremost an ongoing and **private** configuration.

These files are the very core of my configuration, allowing me to build projects and experiments within a sane development environment.
Therefore, this project is meant to stay both as clean and minimal as possible: in fact, each of these files have a singular purpose and are written to be both comprehensible and highly maintainable.


## Installation


The installation is fairly simple. Clone this repository and call the `dotfiles` utility.

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/damienpichard/dotfiles.git "${HOME}/.dotfiles"
$ cd "${HOME}/.dotfiles"
$ ./dotfiles install shell/bash
```
